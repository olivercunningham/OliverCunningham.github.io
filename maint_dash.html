									<h1>Maintenance Dashboard</h1> 
									<p>Project Goal: Automate the creation and distribution of weekly maintenance reports and expand reports to include forecasts for the upcoming week.</p>

								<h2>Background</h2>
								<p>Reports containing information about open work orders were required to be generated on a weekly basis and emailed to the maintenance department management.
									The process involved navigating the compnay's Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) system to download spreadsheets containing data on work orders for the previous week.
									Charts would then be generated in Excel and subsequently be pasted into an email that would be sent to the maintenance department management.
									
								</p>
								<!-- <div class="image main"><img src="images/SMTline.png" alt="" /></div> -->
								<h2>Initialization</h2>
								<p>The objective of this project was to automate the process of generating weekly maintenance reports and dsitributing them to relevant persons.
									Additionally, the project aimed to expand the reports' content by including labour forecasts for the upcomoming week.</p>
								<h2>Initial State</h2>
								<p>The maintenance reports contain charts showing the number of currently overdue work orders for each mechanic and the total number of work orders each mechanic was assigned the previous week.
									A sample of each chart can be seen below.</p>
								<div class="row" ><img src="images/md_overdue_pms.png" style="width:50%" /> <img src="images/md_laboursc.png" style="width:50%" /> </div>
								<br>
								<p>The image on the left shows the number of overdue work orders in orange compared to the number of completed work orders in blue, with each bar representing a mechanic.
									The image on the right shows the total number of work order hours each mechanic completed the previous week.
									It is desirable for each mechanic to have completed 40 hours of work orders each week.</p>
								<h2>Solution</h2>
								<p>A program was created in Python that collects, uploads, and visualizes the data in less than a minute.</p>
								<h3>Data Collection</h3>
								<p>The program headlessly navigates the EAM system and downloads the csv files, or "scorecards", containing the required data for the current week's report and saves them to a specified directory the user's computer.
									Next, the directory is scanned for csv files from the previous week. The previous week's and current week's scorecards are concatenated in a pandas dataframe and saved as a new csv to create a running scorecard of current and past weeks.
								</p>
								<h3>Data Upload</h3>
								<p>The running scorecard is uploaded to a directory on the company's SharePoint website and replaces the previous scorecard to ensure the most recent data is available, along with historical data.</p>
								<h3>Data Visualization</h3>
								<p>A dashboard was created in Power BI on the company's SharePoint website, lnked to the running scorecard, to serve as the new hub for maintenance report data.
									Both previous charts were replicated with the addition of a new chart that shows the assigned hours of work orders for each mechanic for the upcoming week.
									This allows management to see which mechanics are best suited to be assigned new work orders as they arise.
									A screenshot of the GUI and the dashboard is shown below.</p>
								<!-- <img src="images/md_dashboard_cropped.jpg" alt="db" style="width:80%"/> -->
								<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;"><img src="images/md_gui.png" /><img src="images/md_dashboard_cropped.jpg" width="75%" /></div>
								<br>
								<p>The user enters SharePoint and EAM credentials into the program window (left) and the dashboard (right) is updated in less than a minute.</p>
								<h2>Conclusion</h2>
								<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">The dashboard made the following improvements on the existing process:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Reduced the time required and potential for human error when generating reports</li>
									<li>Added labour forecast to increase visibility of labour allocation</li>
									<li>All data is contained within the dashboard with data slicer -- eliminated the need of sifting through emails to find reports for previous weeks</li>
								</ul>
